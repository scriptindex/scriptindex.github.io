Street, school and song +
It's learning from the things +
Left behind as times went on +
Never forgotten, always there. +

There are many things +
worth fighting for, like +
when everyone spreads the +
simple things; love, freedom, +
the right to know what's there +
to know, and feel, family things. +

Humanity - there's another one. +
And writing what you want to say. +
The common cause, lost separation, +
sharing forever with contemplation. +
Some things worth fighting for, +
the physical, mental connection. +

Treacherous seas have we crossed +
to bring and spread, to be together. +
The power is there, flowing passion +
to thrash the hypocritical scheme. +
Musical melodies helping us out +
wholeheartedly. +
