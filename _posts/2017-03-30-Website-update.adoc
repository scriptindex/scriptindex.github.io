Hello everyone! scriptindex here with some recent updates. +

I have now integrated https://disqus.com[Disqus] 
into the site so you can finally comment! +
Your Facebook, Twitter and Google accounts will also work. +
If it's easier, 'I'd rather post as a guest' is there. +

Some other options I've changed: +

- Enabled 'Guest Commenting'
- Deactivated advertisements
- Disabled 'Tracking' and 'Affiliate Links'

Hope you enjoy this site. Let's keep the comments constructive +
so I can work off them to advise and influence my future writing. +

Have a nice day!
