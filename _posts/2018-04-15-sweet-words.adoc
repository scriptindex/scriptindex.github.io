A new era.

---

my lifestyle is one +
born out of influence. +

it revolves around me +
and within me, bringing +
a sense of comfort to me. +

to stay connected to the +
world, to know everything +
I would ever want to know +

to be known countlessly, +
internationally, to be in +
the public eye. +

I see many things +
that others do not +
and it's a damn shame +

since I'm a whisperer +
of the few truths left +
in this fast track world. +

the only omnipresent presence +
that is present in your residence. +

tomorrow is uncertain +
but one thing's for sure +

a life without influence +
is not a life worth living.
