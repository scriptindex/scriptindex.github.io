When you get back into +
the groove of things.

---

on the narrow path +
that we walk on +

You steal my glance +
as we walk past +

that soft face +
sapphire blue +
eyeshadow +
intrigued yet warmed +
by another's presence +

On my way downstairs +
you seemingly depart +
with your long +
black leggings, +
long black hair +

perhaps one day +
I'll see you again +
and things will be +
the same
