We can discover.

---

I am heading in a new direction +
to a place where I shall be welcomed +
yet scorned for being the person +
that I am. +

A society where positivity and +
personal achievements are incredible +
yet the lingering doubts of those +
within continue to create their +
own misconceptions. +

I shall survive regardless of these +
beliefs to make my mark upon this +
populated plane of existence. +

I am not alone. There are others +
of this tribe who shall be and are +
themselves empowered. Inspiration +
is a wonderful thing, you see.
