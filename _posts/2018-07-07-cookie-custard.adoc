delicious.

---

make me a chocolate chip cookie +
and you have my thanks. +

make me dark chocolate chip +
and you'll get my thanks. +

make me white chocolate chip +
and you will get my thanks. +

make me some custard +
and I'll think you're sweet. +

make me custard all week +
and I'll have your custard. +

make a custard of me? +

You can keep your custard.
