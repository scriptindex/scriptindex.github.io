Mixing things up with some +
longer pieces every now and then. +

*'Talk of Time'*

Next time, things will be different. Wherever I look, there is change. +

Last week, there was something new in our little town. At first, I didn't know much about it, but people kept talking and news went around. On my way home, I thought about it and knew there was nothing better. +

Perhaps it's just me. Always thinking too much.

Last week, the whispers reached my ears. Not once did they stop - a curious sight. I'd had enough of these trivial pursuits and knew that truth was close at hand. +

Same old days. No more surprises.

I saw them today on the side of the road. Not much to say, but they looked happy. The chatter stopped eventually, but I knew what I saw. And that was real, not some rubbish about passion or jealousy. It was just something different - a little out of the ordinary and I hope the future can be kind to them.
