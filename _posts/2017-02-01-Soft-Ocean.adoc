= Soft Ocean
:hp-tags: poetry

Here are some words that +
you might enjoy reading.

---

soaring higher +
clinging closer +

when the sky +
hits the ground +
there's a very big +
CRASH +

searching for help +
drifting to shore +
looking for life +
in the New World +

whenever I see +
the others like me +
there's no need +
to stop them. +

A few years later +
they'll know the truth +
but who will be there +
to help them?
