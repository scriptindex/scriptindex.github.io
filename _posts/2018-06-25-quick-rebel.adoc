I have mentioned before +
that I am a scrupulous +
fellow, the kind of +
misconception that has +
no place of his own. +

it's not that I have +
not tried but more of +
that I could not perceive +
the lifestyle of a generation +
such as this +

I need a bucketful of +
custard for my three +
inch muffins. +

I need seven kitchen towels +
to blow my nose dry. +

when life's got me down +
and I'm feeling like a +
chump, I get on my +
knees to praise the Lord +

and all the naysayers +
are just haters +
and I don't need them
bringing me down +

'cause I'd rather +
have integrity +
in my bullish ways +

than be a sweet toothed +
derelict of passion and pain +
with my hands in the air +
whatever the reign. +

when there's not enough to eat, +
I'm the last to complain +

I say one not two +
and not three, but five +

there's always an excuse +
coming out of my face.
