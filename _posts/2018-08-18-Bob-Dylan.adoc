Bob Dylan +
We thank you +

Your influence +
on the medium +
is quite profound +

Your ways have been +
eccentric, challenging +
and rewarding +

The stage is your haven +
of musical creativity +

While your life may have +
been a tumultuous chain +
of events that drained you +
of life's passions +

We appreciate you +
no matter what +

Thank you +
Dylan +

Thank you once again.
