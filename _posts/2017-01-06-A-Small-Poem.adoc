= A Small Poem
:hp-tags: poetry

A few lines of poetry +
that you might enjoy.

*'Is It Me?'*

The little grey rock +
that's under the sea +
.

I'd rather not bother +
the forces beneath me. +
Terrible creatures +
and friend to none.

The future is bleak +
some like to say +
But something inside me +
doesn't want to believe... +

What if there was +
a different way +

W




The little grey rock +
or the biggest mistake +
