A few lines of poetry +
that you might enjoy.

*'Is It Me?'*

the little grey rock +
was thrown in the sea +

its dreams are broken +
its hope is hopeless +

the future is bleak +
some like to say +

the day, the place, +
everything was wrong +

but something inside it +
just can't believe... +

what if there was +
a different way +

why did it have +
to be today +

the little grey rock +
was lost in the sea

no one can find it +
