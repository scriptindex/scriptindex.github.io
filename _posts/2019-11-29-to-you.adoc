honesty. +

---

the last time +
I saw you +

was the first +
time I realised +

just how important +

you are to me. +

-

perhaps you think +

I just don't get it +

and in some ways, +
that may be true +

but the truth is, +

I see everything +

and hear +
everything, +

from the words +
you use, to the +
way you talk, to +

the things you say +
and the way you act +

around me, +

but if you really +
want to know why +

I just don't +
seem to get it +

it all comes down +
to one simple thing. +

are you just +
being playful +

or are you +
actually serious? +

you have the answers +

but I can only guess. +

I've bounced +
between the +
two so much +

I just wasn't +
sure anymore +

but last time +
I saw you +

it felt like, +

"she seems serious" +

so I responded +
to your energy +

with my own. +

I am capable +
of so much +
more, so +

the next time +
you see me, +

make sure +
you know +

what you want, +

show me +
what you mean +

and you will +
see how far +

I can go. +

-

it's no secret +
that we share +

between us +

a distinct lack +
of communication. +

I don't talk to +
many girls, but +

you're certainly +
a strange one. +

when online +
doesn't match +
offline, well +

it's certainly +
an interesting +
situation +

but don't +
forget that +

life is so short +
and who knows +

how long we've +
both got left, so +

before that +
time comes, +

I would like +
to get to know +
you better +

but this +
communication +
thing is a +

two way process +

and I can't +
do this alone. +

-

the last time +
I saw you +

our eyes were +
locked, and +

for the next +
second or two, +

a time lapse. +

there was this +
overwhelming +
sensation +

like my heart +
was a flower +

bud that was +
blooming into +

a lovely flower. +

as it grew larger +
and more vibrant +

there was a ringing +
sound in my ears, +

rising with intensity +

and it was +
becoming so +

overwhelming... +

before the flower +
fully developed, +

before the sound +
drowned me out +

at its peak- +

I forced myself +
to look away. +

the sensation +
went away +

I haven't felt +
it since that +
day, and +

I wonder why +
I looked away. +

-

the last time +
I saw you +

smile, I caught +
a glimpse of +

your lips +

I wondered +
how those lips +
would taste +

when pressed +
against my own +

but in +
those eyes, +

there was +
a sadness +

of some kind +

in those eyes, +

I saw a girl +
who wanted +
to break free +

a girl who knew +
this path was +
not going +

to be easy, +

the girl who +
chose to dream +

and dared to +
follow her own +

so you see, +
sweetheart +

these dreams +
can become +
your reality, +

the reality +
you have been +
searching for +

all these years +

so, if you want +

to make +
your dreams +

come true, +

if you know +
what you want, +

if you want this to work, +

let's work together. +

you, +

me... +

together. +
