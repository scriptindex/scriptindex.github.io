invisible.

---

The absence of love +
once made my heart +
cruel, closed and cold. +

kept deep within +
a block of stained steel +
an ancient lock +
now rusted shut +
its only key thrown +
into the sea +
of lost memories. +

I have searched occasionally +
in my curiosity and realised +
it was absorbing too much of me +
so I let it be. +

I have not yet seen +
love for that +
delicacy +
which has me +
perpetually +
conflicted +

and I began to believe +
this life was mine alone +
and things didn't need +
to change. +

No longer my purpose +
but a suitable addition. +

Never my full focus, but +
a watercolour composition +
with you and I as we dance +
lightly on the lovely paper +
on which I compose these +
lonely sentences. +

But what does this mean +
for those who are curious +
and willing to tempt fate? +

It means +
they'll have +
to wait and see.
