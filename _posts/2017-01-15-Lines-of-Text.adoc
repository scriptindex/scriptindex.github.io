Some huge poetry for all of you!

---

They call it +
creativity +
but it's just +
splats of ink +
on a page. +

It's far too wild +
to keep contained +
it flows from the pen +
and bursts on the page +

but the ink will end +
someday, somewhere +
all the adventures +
gone in a flash +

that day is today +
but tomorrow is +
always forever +
young
