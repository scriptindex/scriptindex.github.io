Tomorrow's the day.

---

paper plates stained with fifteen wet splashes of light yellow paint +
each carefully placed on a cracked wooden chair by the resident high school +
delinquent escaping pursuit from a bunch of relentless adolescents +
observed through the portrait of an intelligent yellow turtle +
with sweaty flippers and a penchant for world peace.
