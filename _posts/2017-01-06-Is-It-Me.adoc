= Is It Me?
:hp-tags: poetry

 A few lines of poetry
 that you might enjoy.

___

the little grey rock +
was thrown in the sea +

its dreams are broken +
its hope is hopeless +

the future is bleak +
some like to say +

the day, the place +
everything was wrong +

but something inside it +
just can't believe +

What if there was +
a different way +

why did it have +
to be today +

the little grey rock +
was lost in the sea

perhaps next time +
it might be lucky.
