= Coloured Concrete
:hp-tags: poetry

The kind of stuff that +
makes the mind wander.

---

Things can be so very hard +
where there are many +
mouths to feed. +

rocks thrown in the sea +
float to the bottom +
and never return +

There are definitely limits to our ways +
of thinking, our beliefs and our lives +

yet there is always time to bring +


despite the constant repercussions. +
