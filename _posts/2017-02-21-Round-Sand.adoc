= Round Sand
:hp-tags: poetry

Tuesday is when the +
week really begins!

---

Inside the story +
of a dense crab +
who thinks too much +
about mostly silly things +

clouding the skies of a +
paltry young woman +
who's always on about +
shellfish and clams. +

It happened one day +
when the tide was low +
close to the shore +
and in plain sight

so off she went +
to grab this crab +

The nicest scuttle for years to come! +

As she knelt near +
with palms on sand +
it was better to +
leave it be. +

"You are unlike anything I've seen!" +

and that was all +
that she could say +
as the spotty crab +
scuttled off to sea
