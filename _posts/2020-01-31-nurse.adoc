it's been a while.

---

I saw you +
only once +

but now, +

it would have +
been nice to +

see you again. +

-

a few years ago +

when I stepped +
into that room, +

we saw each +
other for the +

first time... +

you reminded me +
of that girl I had +
liked so I was +

quite comfortable +
being around you. +

-

though we had +
only just met, +

it felt like +
there was a +
change in you +

however slight +
or great, I could +
not tell, but... +

my intuition was +
on point, and it +

was only natural +
as we talked about +
my Mum and how +

she was doing, +
I wondered what +
kind of woman +

you were, and +
wondered what +

you knew +
about me... +

-

in the weeks +
that passed +

in the months +
that followed, +

I had many +
opportunities +

to see you again +

but I consciously +
chose not to... +

-

my Mum told me +
you were a nice girl. +

she also said +
you were engaged +

but I didn't +
know this +
at the time. +

-

I recall +
one time +

my Mum came in +
for her usual. +

she started +
feeling unwell, +

checkup said +
she was fine +

but you knew +
she wasn't +

so did she, +

so you decided +
to take action... +

you would +
not move +

from your +
position. +

you held her +
so tight and +

you would +
not let go. +

you took care +
of her in other +
ways, and +

slowly +
but slowly... +

she had recovered, +
now well enough to +
head home herself +

so you believed her +
and bid her farewell. +

-

when she +
told me what +
happened, +

it flew right +
past me... +

perhaps I had +
other things on +
my mind, so +

I didn't take +
the chance to +

thank you +
properly +

and slowly +

eventually, +

you stopped +
coming and +

I never saw +
you again. +

-

I'm sorry, Jas. +

it took me +
a while to +
understand, +

I don't know +
why it took +
so long, but +

if we ever +
meet someday, +

I want to +
thank you +

for being yourself +

and I want +
you to know +

she's feeling +
better now. +
