= A Lovely Poem
:hp-tags: poetry

A thoughtful piece +
on Valentine's Day!

*'Red Wish'*

To be the only one +
with the stars on my skies +
when no one else +
would try to tell. +

She says that +
"blue is the colour for me" +
the ever slight curl +
and dangerous glee +

i'd never known the +
smarter side of life +
could grow and experience +
new flavours, ingredients +
but sometimes +
it takes two +

It's gone pretty late, +
everyone is raising hell. +

Who cares about the rest +
with the rough cut stack? +

we've got the finest lines +
to cross. +


You and me +
