= It's There
:hp-tags: poetry

Here is something I cooked up. +
A short snippet that you can read.

___

In that distance only you can see, +
across the oceans and foreign trees, +
a hidden shelter lies in wait. +

Hollow yet welcoming, +
the horizon draws ever near. +

One that you will never know.
