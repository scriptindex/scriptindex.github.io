you're a quiet girl +

and you knew +
what you wanted +

so it's a bit +
unfortunate +

life had +
other plans... +

-

I had seen you +
over the years +

though I knew +
next to nothing + 

about you, +

not even +
your name. +

-

over time, I +
realised your +

interest in me +

was growing +
exponentially, +

your feelings +
were not the +

kind that could +
be hidden easily, +

you felt quite +
differently about +
me, so I thought +

maybe, +

just maybe +

you wanted to +
spend your life +
with me. +

-

perhaps you +
realised I was +
not ready, or +

couldn't properly +
provide for you +

or I just +
didn't feel +

the same way +
about you +

so I wasn't + 
surprised +

you'd tied +
the knot +

all those +
years ago... +

-

part of me +
wonders how +

life could have +
been with you +

but these +
thoughts don't +
matter anymore +

for you and +
I were never +
meant +

to be together. +

-

I recall +
one time +

fairly recently, +

when I was +
walking near you, +

and you +
noticed, and +

you turned +
around, and +

your eyes +
caught mine +

for a brief +

moment +

and I saw +

the girl who +
wondered who +
I really was, +

the one +
who saw me +
differently. +

after all +
this time, +

it's true +
what they say... +

some feelings +
just won't go +
away. . +

-

when I saw +
you today, +

I couldn't feel +
anything for you +

which is a +
good thing, +
since +

that's how +
it should be +

but someday, +

perhaps one day +

I can talk to you +

tell you +
about myself, +

see how life +
has changed +
for you +

and call you +
by your name.
