---

when you saw me +
that day, I saw a +
different side of you +

cheerful, curious +
a little bit shy +
with a lovely smile. +

though I'd known +
you for a while +

we'd never +
really talked +

but when you +
came up to me +

on that +
special day +

I saw a world +
inside your eyes +

full of mystery +
and strife +

which had me +
truly mesmerised. +

if only you +
would enter +
mine. +

-

these games we play +
we have to play +

yet they only +
serve to delay +

the moments you +
and I create in the +
bubbles of our ecstasy. +

-

a few months later +

I was pleasantly +
surprised when +

you called +
me downtown +

to spend some +
time with you. +

I wasn't sure +
what to do +

but I could +
trust you +

though eventually, +

I found myself +
laying next to you +

in this special +
room of yours +

feeling a little + 
out of place +

but when you +
closed the distance +
between our lips, +

as I held your body +
close to mine +

you helped me +
realise one very +
special thing. +

-

my life may have +
lost its meaning +

but when you search +
my eyes, believe me +

your life gives +
my life meaning. +

-

take me apart, +
take your time +

synchronize your +
beats to mine +

brush my fingertips +
upon your lips +
and climb. +

you place your lips +
upon my lips +

you place my hands +
upon your hips +

you rise and fall +
to rise again +

you bring me close +
then far again. +

you tell me +
I'm the only one +

that makes you +
feel this way +

so I guess that +
makes two +

since I'm the +
only one for you. +

-

lost in + 
this fragment +
of time +

within this ecstasy, +
sweat and body heat +
combined +

our feminine, masculine +
energies intertwined +

we are dying together +
to feel this connection +

and we're loving +
every second of it . . +

-

now that you're +
nestled softly +
in my arms +

we can finally relax .. +

-

a lovely smile +
rests on the corner +
of your lips +

as your gaze +
meets mine +

and our fingers +
touch for a +
minute or two .. +

-

all these meetings +
and chance encounters, +

all those moments +
we shared with +
each other +

are just +
the beginning. +

speaking different languages, +
reaching the same message. +

to be the mother +
of my children. +

to spend our +
lives together. +

your imperfections +
may distract me +

but believe me +
when I say +

I will try my best +

to love +
and respect +

every part of you. +

this is the truth. +

it is what you want +

and what +
you +
want +

is all that +
ever matters.
