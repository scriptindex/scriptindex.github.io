only three months +
into the New Year +

and the world +
is in a very +

interesting place... +

...

these days, I am +
mostly at home +

keeping myself +
active and busy +

so I'm never +
really bored. +

there's not +
much to do +

outside, but +

I can always +
pop outside +

for a nice +
long walk +

if I really +
want to... +

-

this social media +
break has been +

so rewarding +

in so many +
ways. it is +

simply one +

of the best +
decisions +

I have made +
recently... +

...

not having all +
those energies +

around me and +
being away from +

those (anti)social +
environments has +

really helped me +
see things in +

my life with +
new eyes, and +

I have a lot more +
time on my hands +

and I'm a much +
happier person +

in general, but +
my stay here +

is only temporary. +

when the +
time comes, +

I will return to +
the other side... +

-

I haven't been +
writing much +

lately. I've +
been reading +
a lot more +

and thinking +
a lot more, so +

it's nice to +
spend more +

time with myself +
and my thoughts... +

-

I would like to +
meditate more. +

for someone +
like myself, +

it has helped me +
in countless ways +

to come up with +
poems, words +

things to say +
how to act, +

what to do +
with my life... +

...

to be honest, +

I can make +
this happen. +

I am capable +
of doing this +

and I want +
to do this +

so it's time +

to put in +
the hard work... +

-

there are things +
I want to write +

but the time +
is not right +

so I'll get +
around to +

those someday... +

-

the poems are +
taking longer +
to write, and +

I'm not as free +
as I used to be +

but I can find +
time to squeeze +
in a few poems +

every now +
and then... +

-

the future is +
uncertain, but +

I am sure +

things will +
be alright... +

-

before I go, +

I want to leave +
a message for +

someone I +
haven't seen +
in a while... +

...

if you are +
reading this, +

it is my +
privilege +

to inform you +

that you +
now have +

my permission +
to contact me. +

...

these are +
very delicate +
circumstances +

and we're +
both going +
to experience +

some tough times +
in the coming future. +

...

it's quite +
unfortunate +

you won't +
be able +

to see me +
for a while +

but it doesn't +
mean we can't +

keep in touch... +

...

the only thing is, +

for this +
to happen, +

you have to +
take this step +
by yourself. +

...

the truth is, +

I have no reason +
to contact you. +

I've done more +
than I should +
have, and now +

the rest is +
up to you... +

...

the truth is, +

once I leave, +
I will not return. +

...

I can't make +
this any clearer +
to you, so... +

listen to +
your heart +

and let it +
guide you +

to what you +
really deserve. +

...

this is your +
last chance +

to show me +
that you care, +

and to show +
yourself that +

you care... +

...

so you see, +
sweetheart +

if you want +
to talk to me +

if you want to +
hear my voice, +

if you don't +
want to lose +
me, then... +

call me . . +
