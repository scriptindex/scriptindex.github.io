relish.

---

to find one's sweetness of faith +
is to absorb a deep reality +

we invoke the spirits of creativity, +
passion and collectivity +

bring balance and objectivity +
to networks of authenticity +

so the common goal is courtesy, +
to challenge adversity not diversity +

and we expect neutrality while + 
we contemplate society with +
varying levels of sobriety +

and each brings its own flavour, +
its own delicacy, that relishes in +
consummations of compatibility +

so quaint these personalities +
conjoined by one humanity +

such is the sweetness of faith +
the tangible yet plentiful +
reality.
