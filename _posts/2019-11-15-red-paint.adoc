I will see you someday.

---

I remember +
the last time +
we met. +

You didn't expect +
me to be there, +

but something +
deep inside +
told me +

I should show +
my support. +

-

As I was waiting +
for you after +
the show, +

I didn't know +
what I would say +

but when you +
walked past, my +
words came out fine +

you finally noticed +
I was standing there, +

so you came +
close, and +

it was nice +
to see you +
and your +
friend again. +

-

After some small talk +
and quick introductions +

I was ready to +
take my leave. +

Fortunately for me, +

Your parents +
kindly decided +
to drop me home. +

-

It was a pretty +
cold night. +

I think it +
was raining +

but it's been +
so long... +

-

As I was +
saying +
goodbye +

I recall shaking +
your hand for a +
few seconds, and +

It was incredibly warm. +

That heat, that moment. +

It was the warmest +
hand I've ever shaken +
in my entire life. +

I think you smiled at +
me, right after that. +

-

A few months later, +

I didn't see you +
at the place +
we first met +

but we stayed +
in touch, and +

you said +
you saw  +
me there +

and I said +

you should +
have said +
hello. +

-

Eventually, +

We lost contact. +

I'm not sure why +

I don't know +
where you went +

I never saw you again... +

-

A few days ago, +
I was thinking +
about my past +

and I saw +

those warm +
hands, +

that picture +
we took, +

your red lipstick, +
red nail polish +

and that +
warm smile +

and I wonder +

all these +
years later +

if I will +
ever +

see you +

again +
