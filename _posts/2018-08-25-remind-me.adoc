say that again.

---

"Why are you here?" +

the words she spoke +
were meant to bite +
but all they could do +
was remind me of +
how far I had come. +

my resolute now hardened +
by years of indifference +
meant things were not +
once how they seemed +

for all the words +
you will ever say +
can not reduce me +
to the state you wish +
to bring upon me +

It is never gonna happen +

and I hope there are no +
hard feelings between us +
since there are no such  +
feelings between us. +

I'll be the judge this time +
so my verdict is clear. +

"I am here for myself, not you." +
