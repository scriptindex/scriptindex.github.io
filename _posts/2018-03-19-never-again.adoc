it repeats.

when it's time to let go +
your memories keep me hanging +
'til I'm pleading on my knees +
please don't let things go on +
like this - let's have some proper +
closure. Let things fall into place. +

it wasn't meant to be like this +
tears falling, misconceptions +
perhaps I'm being too harsh +
on you sweetheart, but I know +
we've been through worse together +

when things aren't working out +
it's time to search in other directions +
there are lots of people out there +
who will give their time +

I want to hear from you again +
there is only so much +
we can handle +

this distance is unhelpful +
the future is inevitable +

why delay that which can +
be done today?
