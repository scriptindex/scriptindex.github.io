It is around us.

---

This is an incredibly unfortunate time. +
The nature of time is a relentless one. +
The time is now 2314 +

Nature is in the spaces of time itself +
weaved and interlocked timelessly +
spread across the colossal expanse +
of this destructive universe. +

This is incredibly fortunate. +
The nature of time is a generous one. +
The time is 2315 +

Time is often misunderstood +
for being itself timeless and +
supposedly never ending. +

2337 +

There is no compensation for +
those without it and no appreciation +
from those that have it. +

2351 +

It is awake +
and watches me +
sleep. +

2359 +

Twenty four hours +
every single day +
for the rest of your life.
