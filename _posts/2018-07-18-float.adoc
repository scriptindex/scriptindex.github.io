reworded.

---

when your life is unsure +
in the first few seconds of +
the early morning sun, +
we have awakened to +
possibility, inability +
not triviality and +
reality. +

when there is no heaven +
I will fight to survive +
in the depths of those eyes +
that bring out the worst +
emotions, devotion, deceptions, +
rebellion, to conspire, transpire, +
control, patrol, petrol, parole +
yet there is no end. +

when I have no worth +
on this planet called Earth +
then bringing with me +
I shall be free of +
confusion, delusion, +
conclusion. +

I hope you are not +
on the receiving end +
of my third eye splitting +
collective creative +
consciousness +
conscious-ness +
con-scious-ness +

for I believe in the power +
of the creative spirit +

so I believe in the survival +
of my creative instinct.
