We live on it.

---

It is that time again +
when angels shed their +
brilliant wings. +

Once worn, this cloak +
never returns to the +
rich depths of flavour +
it once adorned. +

Let me drink that wine +
that you have forsaken. +

Let me taste that thirst +
for which I have forsaken you. +

In the coming months, +
your pain is my anguish +
yet my heart is not yours +

Perhaps it was my selfish nature +
that led me to call you +
here on Earth.
