don't hate me.

---

it's been three weeks +
since I could breathe again +

to explore the beauty +
of life again +

three weeks +
since your bullet +
cracked my skull +

as I lay on my bed +
drowning in my tears +

it took three weeks +
to stop bleeding out +

but I'm still alive +
and I can't stay mad +

because it's not +
my time to +
go out yet. +

lifting my pen +
to write this line +
it slips and drops +
in pools of blood +
I pick it up. +

it's going to take some time +
so just bear with me +

I have other priorities +
besides you and me. +

you've helped me learn +
but now it's on me +

I need some time alone, +
away from you +
and me.
