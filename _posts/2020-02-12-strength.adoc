I see a star.

---

you knew this +
was coming, +
didn't you? +

there's no need +
to explain yourself. +

the words are +
ready, all I have +
to do is write +

or type whatever +
I have to, right? +

-

your omnipotence, +

as it has been +
envisioned since +

the beginning +
of time, +

your child is +
about to take +

his world into +
his own hands +

to an unprecedented +
degree, one which +

requires a careful +
degree of preparation, +

self reflection +
and moderation. +

-

he is going to +
break further +

out of his shell +
in many interesting +
and surprising ways. +

-

your child will +
undertake the +
most difficult +

challenges he has +
ever encountered +
in his life so far +

by choice, head on. +

-

such is the task +
you have given +
him, so I hope +

you may give +
him your power +
and your blessing +

but also your +
wisdom and +
your guidance +

to help him +
recognise when +

he is going astray +
and to stop him +

if he takes things +
too far, or in his +
own words, +

"too seriously". +
