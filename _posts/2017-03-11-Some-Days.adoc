= Some Days
:hp-tags: poetry

The kind of stuff that +
makes the mind wander.

---

Things can be so very hard +
where there are many +
mouths to feed. +

To not be left behind +
in the struggle +
is when true courage +
flows deep.

the odd tiny butterfly +
staring from its corner +
knows a whole lot more +
but a great deal less +

one day it will be gone +
to never return +
again.
