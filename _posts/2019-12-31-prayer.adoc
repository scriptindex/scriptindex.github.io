recently, +

I've been getting +
this feeling that +

I will see you +
again someday... +

-

it was not by +
chance we met +

all those +
years ago, +

but it's +
just one of +

those things, +
you know? +

-

I pray you have + 
been well, that +

your upbringing +
was a tough yet +
rewarding one +

that made you +
stronger as a +
woman, one +

always striving +
to succeed and +

along the way, +
I hope you've +

had some chances +

to see +
everything +

you've always +
wanted to +
experience +

-

I hope culture +
and society +

have not limited +
your true potential +

as you live +
within your means +

of freedom +
and possibility. +

-

I hope your +
future is one +

you have thought +
about very carefully, +

from the words +
you use to the +

various ways +
you present +
yourself +

to those +
around you. +

-

I hope you can +
make or take +
out time to +

express yourself +

in creative, +
healthy and +
productive +

ways, and... +

-

I pray you are +
able to find and +

experience the +
incredible power +
of true love +

but I hope you +
don't get too +
carried away +

in its velvety +
soft wings. . +

-

I hope the man +
you choose, or +
chosen for you +

will be able to +
accept your heart +

and return +
your love +

in the best +
way he can. +

I pray he will +
be faithful to you +

in body and mind +

and you to him. +

-

I hope you will +
be blessed with +

healthy and +
loving kids +

who will +
better your +
lives, your +

families lives, +
your culture and +
your community. +

I pray you have +
taught your kids +

to keep the One +
Creator enshrined +
within their hearts +

and live lives of +
discipline and +
self respect +

with you two as +
their role models. +

-

I hope you do +
not lose hope +

when you are +
facing countless +
difficulties +

on an almost +
daily basis, +

when you are +
constantly +

troubled by +
situations or +
people or +

reactions +
outside of +
your control, +

if you are +
all alone +

and no one + 
wants to +

listen to you +

or help you +

or comfort you +
when you need +
it the most +

-

but most of all, +

I pray you never +
forsake your +
Creator +

for to forsake +
the One who +

brought you +
into this world +

and crossed +
our paths +

so gracefully, +

you would also +
have forsaken me +

so please don't +
do that, okay? +

-

I will always +
believe in you +

even if you +
don't believe +

in yourself, so +

-

when the time +
finally comes +

to leave this +
body behind, +

I pray you will +
leave this world +

with a honest heart +
and clear conscience, +

the love of the universe +
residing inside you, +

in the knowledge +
that your presence, +

and your actions +

on this temporary +
station called Life +

have made +
the world +

a better place +

for both of us. +
