truth.

---

when I look at the faces +
of the many distinct +
individuals across my +
travels, trials and +
tribulations +
 
I see a deeper thread +
that links us all +
that connects the souls +
of every generation +
 
it is unseen +
but exists within +
this truth of words +
this truth of faith. +
 
no one can take it away from us +
no one can say it is not ours +
 
the one true thing that links us all +
has countless forms and proclamations +
 
and it makes sense that +
some may say that yours +
or mine or theirs or ours +
are some things this +
and some things that +
 
but I will believe +
I still believe +
in the power of one. +
 
this centralised community +
this network of neutrality +
a sweeter affection +
beyond indifference +
and trivialities. +
 
for I am blessed +
and we are blessed +
to be in the presence +
of this ever powerful +
ever grateful +
humanity.
