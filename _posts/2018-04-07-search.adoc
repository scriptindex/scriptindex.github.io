a constant struggle.

---

When I have searched +
for something in particular +
I have always found something +
inconspicuous +

There is often a blank space +
where my mind retreats +
in the darkest reaches of +
human civilization +

I perceive a fault +
within that space +
where things happen +
without my consent +

Consumed in my philosophy +
and occasional ethics +
I remain oblivious to the finer +
dealings of my generation +

The real question is: knowing this, +
what difference does it make +
to my life?
