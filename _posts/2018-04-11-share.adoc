To give is to help.

---

Tonight is when +
the snow shall crack. +

Tonight is when +
the lights will burn. +

Last night was wild +
but this is quite +
the ordinary. +

I do not shy from revealing +
my true nature. I am, however, +
a shadow most perplexing. +

One of a kind, in all the right ways. +

You believe that reflections +
shall reveal the truth to you. +

This is false. +

Lose yourself in my abyss +
as I consume the past +
and destroy myself. +

except you +
just you +

my starlight +
firecracker.
