five letters.

---

life is a mixture +
of shortcomings, +
possibilities and +
countless truths +

none of which may +
be in your favour +

but every now and then +

when you have +
the right mindset +

when the stars have +
aligned in your favour +

you will know it. +

you will feel it. +

you will realise +
the time has come +

to create the destiny +
you have always wanted. +

you will realise what +
you are up against. +

you will overcome +
every obstacle +
in your way. +

the only option +
is for you +
to succeed. +

there is your +
ideal situation.
