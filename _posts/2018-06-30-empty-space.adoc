bump.

---

twelve hippopotamus +
brought a tennis racket each +
but they didn't know +
how to hold it +

so when the time came +
they were fumbling around +
and never got the chance +
to play. +

no one is sure how +
they brought them +
in the first place, +
but I don't even know +
how they bought them +
in the first place. +

so they all went home +
and they never came back +
these tennis champions +
had met their match.
