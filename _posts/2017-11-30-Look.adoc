Keys and numbers.

---

Take it away +
that wretched beast! +

It deserves no sympathy +
for the time has long gone.

lost in love, lost in pain +

Never repeat this again.

The past behind us +
is never forgotten yet +
stains the present with +
anticipation.

To return is to forfeit +
and forfeit is malice. +

May you learn your lesson +
and never return. +
