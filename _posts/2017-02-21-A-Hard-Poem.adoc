Tuesday is when we +


*'Round Leaflet'*

Inside the story +
of a dense crab +
who thinks too much +
about mostly silly things. +

Clouding the skies of a +
paltry young woman +
who's always on about +
shellfish and clams. +

It happened one day +
when the tide was low +
and off she went +
to grab this crab +

"You are unlike anything I've seen." +
