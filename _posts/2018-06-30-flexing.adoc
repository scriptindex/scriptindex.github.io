while I'm standing here +
flexing my vocal cords +
on this stage of creativity +

I look back to those days +
when it was just me +
sitting in my bedroom +
with a colouring book +

where I was drawing waves +
of yellow and blue +
scribbling and scrabbling +
for inspiration, +
imagination. +

on the streets have I +
been a rowdy rascal +
on a substance binge +
that doesn't exist +
because I'm a very +
bad boy with no +
friends to play with. +

Perhaps I should +
get off my ass and put +
my gears in overdrive +

maybe, maybe +
baby, just maybe +

I'm just being lazy.
