an experience.

---

fear is by design +
a precursor to success +
it holds your hands tight +
and draws you in. +

when fear has won +
and you have lost +

fear is the shame +
you bring to +
your name. +

fear is reality +
outside our control +
it brings discomfort +
while terror unfolds +

I believe that fear +
is a force for change +

but fear is the killer +
of human beings. +

fear becomes a challenge +
if one is to overcome it +

without fear I am not afraid +
as I have nothing to fear, +

fear is the final piece +
of the puzzle +

a life that lives in fear.
