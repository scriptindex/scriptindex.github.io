= The Forest Trail
:hp-tags: poetry

There are some things +
very dear to all of us.

---

living on the edge +
of the sandy shores +

not the first time +
your pain was felt

before two screens +
distance


the last time +

taken by the calm +
of your sweet touch +

as I take the steps +
into a new world
