= The Forest Trail
:hp-tags: poetry

There are some things +
very dear to all of us.

---

living on the edge +
of the sandy shores +

not the first time +
your pain was felt

the last time +
we spoke, there +
wasn't much to say +


your downcast eyes +

yet as you returned +
my lonely embrace +

I was taken +
by the calm +
of your sweet +
touch +

to live in peace +

true solitude
