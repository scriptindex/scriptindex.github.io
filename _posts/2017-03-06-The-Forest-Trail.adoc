= The Forest Trail
:hp-tags: poetry

There are some things +
very dear to all of us.

---

living on the edge +
of the sharp shores +

not the first time +
your pain was felt.

the last time +
we spoke, there +
wasn't much to say +

your downcast eyes +

my trembling +
heart. +

yet as you returned +
my lonely embrace +

I was taken +
by the calm +
of your +
sweet touch +

to pass my life +
in solitude.
