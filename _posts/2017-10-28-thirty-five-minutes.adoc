Before the busy days.

---

Pupils dilate, morals update +
Libido unstable, no tricks. +

a coy yet anxious glaze +
those curled, parched lips that +
quiver in fright +

rhythmic strokes of your +
light fingertips +

resist the allure +
of your sweet scent

two inches away from +

desperation +

this creamy embrace +
my treat for you.
