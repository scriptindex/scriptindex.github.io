you did exactly as +
I thought you would. +

---

if I only knew then +
what I know now, +

things may have +
been different +

but the past +
can't change +

no matter how +
much we try... +

-

I have realised +

you're not +
my type +

... 

since we last met, +
my preferences +

have changed +
and now... +

you are just +
not what I am +
looking for . . +

-

we're just two +
different people +

living two +
different lives. +

...

the truth is, +

it was never +
meant to be... +

-

looking back, +
there were times +

where you wanted +
me to act, but you +

would never tell me +
directly, and now +

I realise why. +

... 

you wanted me +
to take action, +

act on my +
own behalf. +

if you told me +
what to do, +

it would defeat +
the purpose. +

... 

as a man, I don't +
need to be told +
what to do. +

I should know +
what to do. +

-

looking back, +
I have realised +

I've been expecting +
too much from you +

without realising +
if you were capable +

of doing what +
had to be done. +

... 

the truth is, +

you were more +
capable than +

you thought... +

-

we've both grown +
in our own ways +

but this next +
journey of mine +

is one I have +
to go on alone +

...

you had +
your chance +

but now, +

it's someone +
else's turn... +

* 

you couldn't +
be the one +
for me. +

you couldn't +
get with me. +

...

you couldn't +
win this prize +

baby, and now +

you never will. +

-

I hope you +
find someone +

who is +
compatible +
with you, +

who will join +
you on this +

journey of +
yours, and +

I hope you +

take care +
of yourself, +

take care of +
your family +

and become a +
lovely woman, +

the likes of +
which any +
man would +

want by +
their side. +

... 

the kind +
of woman +

I would +
have loved +
by my side . . +

-

I'll still see +
you around, but +

things just +
won't be the +
same, and +

I'm okay +
with that. +

-

the next time +
you see me, +

you will see +
this change +

for yourself. +

... 

some things +
just have to +

be seen +
in person... +

-

it's finally time +

for me to lay +
this chapter +

of my life +
to rest... +

... 

the fantasy +
was nice +

but we all +
have to grow +
up someday... +

... 

the only thing +
left to say +

is . . +

thank you.
